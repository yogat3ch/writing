<blockquote>
<p>I am also still curious about how people approach and feel about the difficult questions posed by climate change, which are in a sense made more difficult for people who make an effort to live fully consciously.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ive spent a good decade transforming my lifestyle and thinking on the issues posed by climate change and there’s so much that can be done to live sustainably, its important to bring creativity and enthusiasm to the question to realize that the possibilities are endless.<br>
The essence of my personal ethos is:</p>
<p><strong>Live in such a way that if 13 billion other people lived in the same way, the ecological systems will sustain themselves in balance</strong></p>
<p>There’s a lot of things I’ve done and/or continue to do, motivated by the mixture of compassion for life and existential fear that arise with the threat of climate change. I’m just going to list them out chronologically as possible inspiration to you, if you’re interested in the reasoning, let me know?</p>

<p>Does that stoke some ideas for what more you could do?</p>
<p>Responses to your post itself to follow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything we do has an impact, every little choice we make. So one tries to make wholesome choices, but many times it’s the lesser of two evils. It’s which action i take will bring less harm or cause less suffering. But nothing I do can actually be called good, in a sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s very defeatist of you and may be coming from a place of binary thinking. Your choices can have multiplicative and sometimes exponential impact depending on the choice you make! A low-hanging fruit, based on your post, would be to consider eliminating dairy from your diet. There’s the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8657189/#:~:text=Intensive%20dairy%20production%20also%20affects,high%20cattle%20numbers%20including%20overgrazing.">environmental impact</a> to consider as well as the suffering doing so will eliminate:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ct6tnM8Ms6x/">humorous take</a> on the suffering</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.facebook.com/garytvcom/videos/283781445542917/">glimpse of the sheer scale of suffering the dairy industry creates</a></li>
<li>It breaks the first precept as a byproduct because <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/my-drive">they kill male calves</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you do so, be sure to pick up a b-complex supplement because dairy is a source of B-12 which must be consumed from external sources. There are <a href="https://veganoutreach.org/vegan-mentorship-program/">mentors available</a> for making the transition and I’d also be happy to entertain questions you might have!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This led me to vegetarianism, and will likely make me vegan at some point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grateful the consideration for the environment led you in the direction of vegetarianism! That’s definitely the right track!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought I’d have some time to “transition”, but I feel more and more compelled to take that next step. Part of me wonders where this stops? Like, will I eventually come to the conclusion that suicide is called for? Are there circumstances where suicide is right action?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well if you’re Putin or Trump, arguably you’d be reducing the net suffering pretty dramatically by offing yourself. Maybe think about it in terms of the overall suffering that would be eliminated if you did so, given you’re already on this path of waking up - which is a rare and precious discovery for a human life, killing yourself is unlikely to reduce harm and will likely lead to more of it given the potential impact you may have</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are we approaching this time? People are already deciding to forego children, which is a sort of suicide (I meant this in the sense that people sometimes feel that they live on through their children, it’s a bit of a stretch)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you believe that the only way in which humans live is through their meat suits? Suggesting that not having children is suicide seems to imply such a belief. Children are a physical incarnation of a merging between two people and have their own agency.<br>
Doesn’t this neglect the karma of the consciousness of an individual?<br>
What about the lasting impact of one’s actions in the world? The ideas communicated? The love shared? The people on who’s life you made a difference? The experiences you had and the paths they leave for others in your wake?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also feel compelled to voice my opinion in defense of “the planet/future generations/animals”, but i’m wary of a tendency in my self that wants to evangelize and convert people to my cause, to be a prophet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what? If you’re doing it from a place of non-attachment to the outcome, then have at! You seem to be moved from a place of care, so if you do it in a skillful way you might have a net positive impact. It’s worth trying!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been mulling over a letter to the editor for our local paper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do it!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when one sits down to write, one tends to ask oneself why and what they hope to accomplish. When really mulling these questions over, I see that I maybe I don’t care as much as I thought about the planet etc. Maybe I care more about being seen as the brave, forward looking soul who had the courage and fortitude to bring disparate people together and finally get them rowing in the same positive direction. Which is vanity. And in the end it is ALL vanity, isn’t it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next time you sit down, try to breath a little more and not overanalyze. See if you can tap into and be moved by the compassion for all life and come from that place in your writing. Maybe try a meditation where you center your awareness of breath in your heart center beneath your sternum, and then sit down to write afterwards. Tell us how it goes?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.” -Ecclesiastes 1:14<br>
Yup, the Bible confirms it, it’s all vanity. ;p</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a figure of speech from centuries ago is the gospel that’s going to undermine your volition?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So then I think, maybe the best I can do, rather than add yet another egotistical voice with all it’s own shadowy motivations to the general cacophony, is be quiet and provide the space and stillness that’s so seemingly lacking. But ultimately that space and stillness and silence isn’t lacking at all. There’s nothing I can do to make the world any better than it is. Even with all the chaos and gluttony and horror, the world is absolutely, perfectly, exquisitely what it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is perfect, and completely empty, just as it is. AND, there is a planet existing in the future beyond your stay on it with more or less suffering for the beings that inhabit it depending on how you live your life. It’s a paradox, indeed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyhoo, I thought it might be interesting to get other peoples opinions on all this. How do you think about it all? Do you feel called to action? To speech? How do you know if these calls are wholesome?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I try to allow myself to be moved from a place of compassion for all sentient life. I try to seek out activities that will cultivate the awe and reverence I feel for the animals, plants, all the life and natural beauty this world is blessed with. By remembering my motivation, I am frequently moved to act in ways that protect the harmony and beauty in the natural systems which support my existence. I hope you find it easier to do so too!</p>
